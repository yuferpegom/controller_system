## Controller System

This app is composed by 3 sub-modules

# Devices

Generates the readings of the different IoT Devices. Publishes the events to a kafka topic

# Devices subscriber

Consumes the events generated by the devices. Saves them in the DB

# Common

Contains shared code among modules. It might contain http clients among other stuff. It contains only the proto files for now.

# Important

Because of issuen 3, the artifacts are not being generated correctly so in order to run the modules you'd need to use sbt:

`sbt devices/run`
`sbt devices_subscriber/run`
